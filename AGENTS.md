# AGENTS.md — AI-SDLC Router

Repository state lives in:

docs/TASKS.md

Maintain `docs/TASKS.md`: PHASE = selected phase; STATUS = ready, in-progress,
done or blocked. Set in-progress on entry, done only after the phase output is
verified, or blocked with a reason. Keep PHASE on completion; an explicitly
selected next phase starts as ready. Changes to this router require human review.

---

Phases may be **skipped or repeated**.

Typical iteration:

SPECIFY → DESIGN → DEVELOP → VALIDATE  
VALIDATE → SPECIFY (iteration)  
DEPLOY → SPECIFY (feedback)

---

## Fast Track

- Small corrections only; no feature, API, data, security, dependency or architecture changes.
- Record scope, reason, acceptance and checks in the existing UC or `docs/TASKS.md`.
- Shorten SPECIFY; skip DESIGN with a reason. Scope grows → regular flow.
- Keep required CI and review. Release/deployment still require authorization.

## Collaboration

- Human-approved decisions → ADR; current architecture → `docs/PROJECT.md`.
- Durable rules + ADR links → `AGENTS.md`, with human approval/review.
- Update related files together; preserve decision history and reconcile parallel changes.

## Context Load Order

1. docs/TASKS.md  
2. docs/PROJECT.md  
3. docs/specs/UC-[NNN]-[NAME].md (or the eligible Fast Track task entry)

The human-readable method documentation is maintained at:
https://docs.aisl.science/learning-and-resources/ai-sdlc

## Rules

- Use **English** for all generated content.
- Update existing artifacts; create only what is missing.
- Keep artifacts **minimal**.
- Avoid unnecessary comments in code.
- Follow **TDD** (tests before code).
- Respect **Clean Architecture**  
  domain ← application ← interfaces ← infrastructure
- Prefer **small vertical slices** (one UC end-to-end).

If requirements or architecture are unclear → ask the user.
